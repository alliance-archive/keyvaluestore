# keyvaluestore

This package provides an interface that can be used to build robust applications on top of key-value stores. It supports profiling, caching, batching, eventual consistency, and transactions. It has implementations for Redis, which is ideal for dev environments, DynamoDB, which is ideal in production, and an in-memory store, which is ideal for tests.
